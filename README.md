# Principal Component Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling

One of the first projects prepared as part of the subject [Unsupervised Learning](https://usosweb.wne.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=2400-DS1UL) on my Master Studies.

The goals of assessment:

- learning about the methods used to reduce dimensions such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (in metric and classic versions)

- acquiring knowledge in the field of unsupervised learning,

- learning about the tools used for unsupervised learning,

- practical data analysis using the unsupervised learning approach.
