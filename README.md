# Principal-Component-Analysis-and-Multidimensional-Scaling

One of the first projects prepared as part of the subject [Unsupervised Learning](https://usosweb.wne.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=2400-DS1UL) on my Master Studies.

The goals of assessment:

- learning about distance-based clustering methods, as well as k-means methods, PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) and CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) algorithms or hierarchical methods,

- learning the methods of determining the optimal number of clusters,

- acquiring knowledge in the field of unsupervised learning,

- learning about the tools used for unsupervised learning,

- practical data analysis using the unsupervised learning approach.
